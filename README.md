# ProyectoAPCC - Tensorflow Quantum
 
This project was the final assignment of the subject "Arquitectura y Programación de Computadores Cuánticos" which I took during my third year studying at UCM.

In my case, I choose to explore TensorFlow Quantum and its applications to Quantum Computing using Cirq. As a prototype, I developed a Neural Network that learned how to configure the rotations of the gates in the circuits so that it ended up implementing Quantum Teleportation and Superdense Coding. 

The result of the project can be found in "Memoria Tensorflow Quantum.pdf"
